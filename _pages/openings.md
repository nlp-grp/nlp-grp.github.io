# Open positions

**Note: Currently, only Dr. Kim has funding for additional PhD positions. The other professors can only welcome you if you have a fellowship.**


We are looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work in the growing field of natural language processing: its use for the study of language, its interface with computer reasoning, and its application in analyzing human behaviors both within and beyond the field of computer science. 

### Applications for PhD positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student, please send Dr. Kim an [email](mailto:genekim@usf.edu) and submit an application to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at USF. In your email, state briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ in the subject line so that I don't miss it.

### Master projects for Leiden University students
If you are a Master student at USF looking for a Master project, contact Dr. Kim per email or stop by his office.
