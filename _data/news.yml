  headline: "Dr. John Licato will give a talk on **ChatGPT, Cheating, and Chaos: What All Educators Need to Know, and What's Next** \n\n **Abstract:** Much has been said about the ways in which ChatGPT is going to change the world, if it hasn't already. Unfortunately, much of what is being said is either dramatically overexaggerated, or dramatically underexaggerated. I will provide a soft introduction to the technological and natural language processing (NLP) advances that made ChatGPT possible, to provide a clearer perspective on what kind of reasoning ChatGPT and its relatives are and are not capable of. But more importantly, I attempt to provide a balanced take on what is coming next, drawing from current research into reasoning using large language models. I will argue, in no uncertain terms: any educator at the college level who is not planning on adjusting their course to prepare for the changes that are already here is in real trouble. \n\n [Join via Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_NjAxY2QxYmEtYWMxMS00MmMyLWE5YjAtOTM5OWI0Y2JiZTcw%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22741bf7de-e2e5-46df-8d67-82607df9deaa%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22a4f34152-dd02-421b-a070-bbb003895dde%22%7d)"
